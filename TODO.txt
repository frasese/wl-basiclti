basiclti-blis/src/java/org/sakaiproject/blti/ServiceServlet.java

Add LORI-support to Velocity-based LTI structures - will 
require conversion :(

=======  COMPLETED ========

Make sure collections work

Add ServerConfiguration stuff.

Figure out why folderId is not round tripping

Add UI to tick enabling LORI in portlet

Return tempids after addCourseResources

processAddResourcesXML - check siteid in addition to page id

Make sure to match the siteId and check the userId after sourcedid

Refactor the key/value code to be smarter about when to include 
extension attributes.

Check with Scriby to see if I can architecturally ignore the PKI 
key and just use sourcedid.  If so - work through code to insure
sourcedid is what I think it is throughout.
