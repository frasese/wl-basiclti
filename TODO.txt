Add UI to tick enabling LORI in portlet

Check with Scriby to see if I can architecturally ignore the PKI 
key and just use sourcedid.  If so - work through code to insure
sourcedid is what I think it is throughout.

Refactor the key/value code to be smarter about when to include extension
attributes.
basiclti-common/src/java/org/sakaiproject/basiclti/util/SakaiBLTIUtil.java

Refactor ServiceServlet into several files - Avoid ResourcesAction syndrome :)
basiclti-blis/src/java/org/sakaiproject/blti/ServiceServlet.java

Add ServerConfiguration stuff.

Make sure to match the siteId and check the userId after sourcedid

Clean up JSON to match XML 

   name -> title

Clean up test harnesses for new XML and new JSON

Talk to Stephen

Update API documentation
